            OMNIS is a personal intelligence hub, designed to store and manage knowledge efficiently. Built as an extension of my work, it holds programming projects, presentations, and curated informationâ€”both for myself and those I choose to add.

            More than just a repository, OMNIS is a structured system for tracking ideas, analyzing progress, and keeping essential data within reach. Whether itâ€™s code, research, or key insights, everything is connected here.
            <ul>
                <li>ðŸ”¹ Programming Projects â€“ A collection of past and ongoing developments.</li>
                <li>ðŸ”¹ Presentations & Research â€“ Structured knowledge, ready to access.</li>
                <li>ðŸ”¹ Profiles & Records â€“ Data on individuals I choose to include.</li>
            </ul>
            OMNIS is my personal archiveâ€”a system built for precision, organization, and control.
